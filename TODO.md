# Refactor

- [ ] Create hooks for sorting projects - Eventually it will support filtering for main page.
- [ ] Move iframe rendering into separate component that receives the url, and also the configuration for the rendering of the iframe, i.e. url, height, etc. This way it can be used in other non-default project pages.
- [ ] Add Husky hook to validate build on commit; and deploy to gh-pages.
- [ ] Add short description to images

# Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for... everything
