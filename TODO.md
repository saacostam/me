# TODO

# Refactor

- [ ] Create projects filtering component to check and manage current projects filter
- [ ] Add images for slippery slope, tetris and piano-roll.
- [ ] Add link to repo, per each project.
- [ ] Add short description to images.
- [ ] Move iframe rendering into separate component that receives the url, and also the configuration for the rendering of the iframe, i.e. url, height, etc. This way it can be used in other non-default project pages.
- [ ] Use small and normal-sized images for projects.
- [ ] Move project pagination to re-usable component

# Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for... everything
