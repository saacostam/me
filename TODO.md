# TODO

# Refactor

- [ ] Move to the top of the page
  - Maybe by going to a specific element id or by going to the top of the page on router change.
- [ ] Add images for slippery slope, tetris and piano-roll.
- [ ] Add link to repo, per each project.
- Lalu: Fix song display for artist page
- [ ] Check all projects and their link-backs, to point to new url.
  - [ ] Fake Store API
- [ ] Add short description to images.
- [ ] The viewport alerts must be moved to separate component (including state).
- [ ] Move iframe rendering into separate component that receives the url, and also the configuration for the rendering of the iframe, i.e. url, height, etc. This way it can be used in other non-default project pages.
- [ ] Use small and normal-sized images for projects.
- [ ] Move project pagination to re-usable component

# Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for... everything
