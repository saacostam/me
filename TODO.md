- [ ] Paginate projects (FE).
- [ ] Add link to repo.
- [ ] Add short description to images.
- [ ] Move iframe rendering into separate component that receives the url, and also the configuration for the rendering of the iframe, i.e. url, height, etc. This way it can be used in other non-default project pages.
