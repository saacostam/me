# TODO

# Refactor

- [ ] Migrate data to modules, and remove all data folders
- [ ] Move iframe rendering into separate component that receives the url, and also the configuration for the rendering of the iframe, i.e. url, height, etc. This way it can be used in other non-default project pages.
- [ ] Update header component in: `src/modules/skills/skills.tsx`.
- [ ] Add Husky hook to validate build on commit; and deploy to gh-pages.

# Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for... everything
